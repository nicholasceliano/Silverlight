Silverlight
===========

<b>Description: </b> This application serves as a portal for Treasury business uners to manage their accounts and the signers for the accounts. This solution contains a silverlight project which compiles into a .xap file and is published along with the main project. The project uses entity framework and crossdomain web services for the silverlight front and the SQL backend to communicate with eachother.
